Basic usage instructions.


= Details =

Right now only reading of *.kdb files AES + SHA256 encrypted is supported.
Pretty straightforward:
{{{
KeePassDataBase keePassDb = KeePassDataBaseManager.openDataBase(new File(
				"testing-pass-key.kdb"), new File("testing-key.key"), "testing");
		KeePassDataBaseV1 kdb1 = (KeePassDataBaseV1) keePassDb; 
		kdb1.getGroups();
		kdb1.getEntries();
}}}

key file or password can be *null* never both. Have fun!
